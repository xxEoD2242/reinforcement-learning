# Reinforcement Learning

Code work throughs of the classic RL book "Reinforcement Learning"
by R. Sutton and A. Barto. (Link)[https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf]

## Getting Started
1. To get started, clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/xxEoD2242/reinforcement-learning.git
```
2. (Optional) Install a VirtualEnv with Python version 3.7 or greater.

3. Install all dependencies with the following command, after activativating
your Virtual Env:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once this is completed, you can utilize any of the models. To run tests, we
utilize the Pytest framework.

### Running tests
Pytest should already be installed. To run pytest, simply type `pytest` in
a terminal.

## Future Work
This repository will continue to be a selection of tools that I utilize for
both learning and for research. Contributions to this work are greatly
appreciated. I can be contacted at tyler.fedrizzi@gmail.com as well.
